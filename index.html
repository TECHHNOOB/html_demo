        <p class="styles">Some iPhone owners also found the bug was causing Apple Music to make it default music service for Siri requests, kicking off Spotify.

            In a tweet, Epic Games Founder and CEO Tim Sweeney said: "I just verified this on iOS 15.4.1. With Spotify installed and on the dock, installing Apple Music removed Spotify from the dock and put Apple Music there - without asking. Happens without Apple Music being run, so clearly Apple has rigged their OPERATING SYSTEM to do this!"
            
            Epic is already fighting a long-drawn antitrust lawsuit with Apple.
            
            In fact, the Apple Music app replaced all sorts of apps that were in users' docks, including first-party apps like the built-in Camera app.</p>
